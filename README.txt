Provides a widget containing links for exporting events to:

* Google Calendar
* Yahoo! Calendar
* iCal
* Outlook

## Usage
1. Open the widget's field display settings
2. Change the date field's format setting to _Add to Cal_

## Settings
### Location Field
You can optionally choose a location field in the format settings view. This option will choose which of the entity's fields will populate the location value for calendar export. 

## Caveats
Currently only works with nodes, but will soon be extended to other entity types.

The module assumes that 'body' is used for the event description.
